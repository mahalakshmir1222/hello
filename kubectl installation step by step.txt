================================================================
Update the package manager's package list by running the following command:
sudo apt-get update

Install the apt-transport-https package, which is required to retrieve packages over HTTPS:
sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https

Add the Google Cloud Package Repository configuration to your system:
echo "deb https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list

Download the GPG key used to sign the packages:
curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -

Update the package manager's package list again:
sudo apt-get update

Install kubectl by running the following command:
sudo apt-get install kubectl

That's it! kubectl should now be installed on your system. To verify that the installation was successful, you can run the following command:

kubectl version
This should print the version number of kubectl that was installed.
